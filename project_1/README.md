# Project 1: Nice and easy

Develop an application that uses the following tech stack:

- `Flask` framework
- Class-based HTML/CSS framework

## Requirements

The web site must meet the following criteria:

- At least 3 individual pages/routes, all linked to one another
- `main` content is divided into subsections using `article`, `ssection`, and `div` elements
- At least 2 of the following semantic HTML tags are used:
  - `header`
  - `nav`
  - `sidebar`
  - `footer`
- Bootstrap or Bulma used to style the site
  - Try both and justify your decision to use one or the other

## Approach

This project is deliberately ~~vague~~ open-ended but here are some suggestions:

- Find an interesting dataset or some content you like.
- Make heavy use of any class-based HTML/CSS framework and their grid model.
  - Do not spend too much time writing custom CSS.
- Use `Jinja` templates as plain HTML without any control elements or placeholders.
  - Build a static HTML site.

## Demonstration

You will present your project to the group.
Start your application from the command line using the following command:

```bash
flask run
```

Use `--debug` option during the development phase to automatically reload the application:

```bash
flask run  --debug
```
