# Web Development

## Course

The goal of the 4-day course is to develop and deploy a web application using `Flask`, `Jinja`, and `MVP.css` in order to present data from CSV files on the web.

### Tentative course schedule

1. Data handling: CSV, Flask
    - Data from a CSV file displayed on the web
2. UI design: HTML, CSS, Jinja
    - Templates used to present data
3. Interactivity: forms and methods
    - HTML forms used to access data
4. Deployment: Python hosting
    - Final version of the application is deployed

## Guided research

Students participating in the guided research section are going to extend upon the content of the course in order to develop a full-stack web application using the following tools and techniques:

- `Flask` for the back-end logic
- `Jinja` for templates
- `Bootstrap` or `Bulma` for consistent user interface
- `JavaScript` to interact with the application's API
- `SQLite3` for the permanent data storage
- `Playwright` and `pytest` for testing
- `git` for version control
- `PythonAnywhere` or `render` for hosting

### Tentative research schedule

Students are expected to start working on the final project by the end of the second week but the last two days are going to be dedicated to the project.

Tentative break up of the topics is as follows:

- Week 1: data formats, HTML/CSS, testing, and git
- Week 2: SQL and JavaScript
- Week 3: putting the pieces together and working on the final project

### Projects

`Python`, `Flask`, and `Jinja` are used in every project but in most cases projects focus on different elements of the web development tech stack.

Final project is open-ended but students are supposed to use build an application with a consistent user interface, `SQLite` as a data storage, and logic/routes implemented using `Flask`.
