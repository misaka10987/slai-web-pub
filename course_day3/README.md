# Day 3: Interactivity

We add HTML form to the front of our application to interact with the logic (back-end).

## Learning goals

- Use various elements of HTML forms to retrieve subset of the dataset from the back-end of the application.
- Learn basics of HTTP methods.

## Process

New features added to the application:

1. Data exploration script returns a `list` of dictionaries with values converted to the proper types (`int`, `bool` etc).
2. Main route handles both `GET` and `POST` methods, rendering either a form or the resulting table.
3. A new function, `query`, is used to filter the results based on the form values.
4. HTML form with various types of `input`:
    - `select/option`, `checkbox`, `text`, `number`, `submit`.

## Demo

1. HTML form is used to interact with data and retrieve specific records.

## Student outcomes

Students should be able to:

1. Use HTML forms
2. Use `flask.request.form` to retrieve data submitted by users
